# iOS Scroll View Example

###### App to help with scrollview problem

I followed the example:  [Scroll View Layouts With Interface Builder](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/scroll-view-layouts-with-interface-builder/)
Must have missed something. StackOverflow Question: [iOS UIScrollView Issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59823849/ios-uiscrollview-issues/59825591#59825591)
Followed Samiul Islam Sami advice and everything worked.
Matic Oblak also has a good technique for using the scroll view.

I later added keyboard support using some code from the links below. Stil not perfect.
[How to adjust a UIScrollView to fit the keyboard](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-adjust-a-uiscrollview-to-fit-the-keyboard)
